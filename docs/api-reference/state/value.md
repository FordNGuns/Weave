</h1>

Stores a single value which can be updated at any time.

```luau
(
	initialValue: T
) -> Value<T>
```

---

## Parameters

- `initialValue` - The value that should be initially stored after construction.

</p>

### :octicons-code-24: Value:get()

Returns the current value stored in the state object.

If dependencies are being captured (e.g. inside a computed callback), this state
object will also be added as a dependency.

```luau
(asDependency: boolean?) -> T
```

#### Parameters

- `asDependency` - If this is explicitly set to false, no dependencies will be
  captured.

</p>

### :octicons-code-24: Value:set()

Replaces the currently stored value, updating any other state objects that
depend on this value object. The value is stored directly, and no cloning or
alteration is done.

If the new value is the same as the old value, other state objects won't be
updated.

```luau
(newValue: T) -> ()
```

#### Parameters

- `newValue` - The new value to be stored.

??? note "Table sameness"
Updates are always sent out when setting a table value, because it's much
more difficult to evaluate if two tables are the same. Therefore, this
method is conservative and labels all tables as different, even
compared to themselves.

??? caution "Legacy parameter: force"
Originally, a second `force` parameter was available in Fusion 0.1 so that
updates could forcibly be sent out, even when the new value was the same as
the old value. This is because Fusion 0.1 used equality to evaluate sameness
for all data types, including tables. This was problematic as many users
attempted to `:get()` the table value, modify it, and `:set()` it back into
the object, which would not cause an update as the table reference did not
change.

    Fusion 0.2 uses a different sameness definition for tables to alleviate this
    problem. As such, there is no longer a good reason to use this parameter,
    and so it is not currently recommended for use. For backwards compatibility,
    it will remain for the time being, but do not depend on it for new work.

## Example Usage

```luau
local numCoins = Value(50) -- start off with 50 coins
print(numCoins:get()) --> 50

numCoins:set(10)
print(numCoins:get()) --> 10
```
