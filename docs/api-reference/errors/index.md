Whenever Weave outputs any errors or messages to the console, it will have a
short error ID at the end. This is used to uniquely identify what kind of error
or message you're seeing.

Use the search box below to paste in or type an error ID, and it will scroll to
the details for you.

## cannotAssignProperty

```
The class type 'Foo' has no assignable property 'Bar'.
```

This message means you tried to set a property on an instance, but the property
can't be assigned to. This could be because the property doesn't exist, or
because it's locked by Roblox to prevent edits.

This usually occurs with the [New](../instances/new) or
[Hydrate](../instances/hydrate) functions:

```luau
local folder = New "Folder" {
	DataCost = 12345,
	ThisPropertyDoesntExist = "Example"
}
```

!!! tip
Different scripts may have different privileges - for example, plugins will
be allowed more privileges than in-game scripts. Make sure you have the
necessary privileges to assign to your properties!

## invalidSpringDamping

```luau
local speed = 10
local damping = -12345
local spring = Spring(state, speed, damping)
```

Damping ratio must always be between 0 and infinity for a spring to be
physically simulatable.

This message means you gave a speed to a [spring object](../animation/spring)
which is less than 0:

```luau
local speed = -12345
local spring = Spring(state, speed)
```

Since a speed of 0 is equivalent to a spring that doesn't move, any slower speed
is not simulatable or physically sensible.

## multiReturnComputed

```
Returning multiple values from Computeds is discouraged, as behaviour will change soon - see discussion #189 on GitHub.
```

This message means you returned more than one value from a [computed object](../state/computed).
There are two ways this could occur; either you're explicitly returning two
values (e.g. `return 1, 2`) or you're calling a function which returns two
values (e.g. `string.find`).

A simple fix is to surround your return expression with parentheses `()`, or to
save it into a variable before returning it.

## springTypeMismatch

```
The type 'number' doesn't match the spring's type 'Color3'.
```

Some methods on [spring objects](../animation/spring) require incoming values to
match the types previously being used on the spring.

This message means you passed a value to one of those methods, but it wasn't the
same type as the type of the spring.

```luau
local colour = State(Color3.new(1, 0, 0))
local colourSpring = Spring(colour)

colourSpring:addVelocity(Vector2.new(2, 3))

## unknownMessage

```
Unknown error: attempt to index a nil value

If you see this message, it's almost certainly an internal bug, so make sure to
get in contact so the issue can be fixed.

When Fusion code attempts to log a message, warning or error, it needs to
provide an ID. This ID is used to show the correct message, and serves as a
simple, memorable identifier if you need to look up the message later.
However, if that code provides an invalid ID, then the message will be replaced
with this one.

## unrecognisedChildType

```
'number' type children aren't accepted as children in `New`.
```

This message means you tried to pass something to [Children](../instances/children.md)
which isn't a valid [child](../instances/child.md). This usually means that you
passed something that isn't an instance, array or [state object](../state/stateobject.md).

```luau
local instance = New "Folder" {
	[Children] = {
		1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

		{true, false},

		State(Enum.Material.Grass)
	}

Note that state objects are allowed to store `nil` to represent the absence
of an instance, as an exception to these rules.

## unrecognisedPropertyKey

```
'number' keys aren't accepted in the property table of `New`.
```

This message means, while using [New](../instances/new) or [Hydrate](../instances/hydrate),
you specified something in the property table that's not a property name or
[special key](../instances/specialkey).

Commonly, this means you accidentally specified children directly inside of
the property table, rather than using the dedicated [Children](../instances/children.md)
special key.

```luau
local folder = New "Folder" {
	[Vector3.new()] = "Example",

	"This", "Shouldn't", "Be", "Here"

## unrecognisedPropertyStage

```
'discombobulate' isn't a valid stage for a special key to be applied at.
```

Fusion provides a standard interface for defining [special keys](../instances/specialkey.md)
which can be used to extend the functionality of [New](../instances/new.md) or
[Hydrate](../instances/hydrate.md).

Within this interface, keys can select when they run using the `stage` field.
If an unexpected value is passed as the stage, then this error will be thrown
when attempting to use the key.

```luau
local Example = {
	type = "SpecialKey",
	kind = "Example",
	stage = "discombobulate",
	apply = function() ... end
}

local folder = New "Folder" {
	[Example] = "foo"
}
```
